week 9

dolphins at chiefs, 1pm
chiefs on short week coming off big win, spreads have it at about a td, ypp has it at 10, prs only slightly edge to kc, both in the 20s, neither team does anything particularly well, kcs def int rate is really high, mia stops the run ok, mia doesnt get a lot of penalties, cant really get a read right now

jets at bills, 1pm
jets coming off bye, spreads have bills by td+, ypp though is 4.5, both teams are relatively close in prs, bills have a much better offense, but not the best d, jets d is decent at stopping the pass, avg at stopping run, bills actually throw some ints which would help the jets, both are really good at causing ints, too close to call either way here

browns at texans, 1pm
spreads have it at about 13-15, big separation in prs, I feel like hou is hitting their stride while cle is stumbling, cle's 2nd game on the road, cle is one full sd below avg for scoring, both have decent scoring defenses, pass eff is hou 4/4 cle 30/7, cle cant run and both are avg stopping the run, surprisingly hou rates as avg running the ball, but they are very balanced, hou takes care of the ball pretty well, browns have shitty off fumble numbers, I think the texans take care of business here

seahawks at cowboys, 1pm
spreads are dal -9.5 to -11.5, ypp is only -4.5, sea's scoring offense is pretty putrid, both have avg scoring d's, seahawks have the best run defense in football, damn, both teams are avg across to's and pen, i sort of like sea, its just hard to see them scoring a whole lot of points, boys have the top sos, think its a must win in a way for dal, but will they cover?, giving one star to sea

49ers at redskins, 1pm
first things first, i dont like the niners going across the country for a morning game as a road fav, spreads have them winning by 10-11, but is it a trap game?, ans has them 5 better and dvoa has it at 21, was has lost 3 straight, niners d is for real i think, was can get after the passer but i think sf can negate that with it's running game, it is a tad scary though bc sf is near the bottom of the league in giving up sacks, both teams cause fumbles and are about avg at giving them up, sf doesnt throw ints, best in league, was last

falcons at colts, 1pm
falcons coming off bye, play saints next week, atl ranks 2 in sos, spreads have atl covering with relative ease (surprise), colts are last in the league in scoring d, though look what stl did last week, both teams are just sort of average in efficiency stats, though the falcons cause interceptions, atl takes care of the ball better, neither team can pass all that well or stop pass, sort of uninspired here, could sort of see colts covering, but for no good reason, i mean atl could be flat coming off bye, road fav of a td, has big div game next week, i think they win, but something tells me they win ugly, plus the colts have to win a game at some point, non-conference road fav sounds dangerous, this would be a ballsy pick to go colts, hmmmmmmmmmm, going one star for indy

bucs at saints, 1pm
bucs off bye, revenge game for saints, plus they are coming off ugly loss which now give this game more meaning for them, bucs are 5 in sos, all spreads have this btwn 13-15 for NO, pr favors NO, bucs are pretty bad at stopping the pass, saints are good, saints have the worst run d in football, both teams protect the passer well, not really an edge for either team in to's, big edge to NO in penalties, I like NO here, they dont want to go to atl 5-4, they need to regain division, NO tcb, 3 stars

bengals at titans, 4pm
both teams have weak sos, bengals have huge game next week with steelers at home, but they want to make sure they pick up a game with one of bal and pit for sure losing this week, spreads have them winning, ans game probs give them 34% chance to win, ans also has the titans ranked higher, dvoa only has them 3 lower, cins d looks damn good on paper, just hard to take bengals and their rookie led offense, i do see value here but i see risk as well

broncos at raiders, 4pm
i think the broncos can cover, thats all im saying, moving on

giants at pats, 4pm
i see this game similar to the dal at ne game, nyg can throw the ball and keep them in the game, they have an ok d vs ne's pretty shitty d, they match up equal in prs ne 7/8 nyg 9/7, just a bit worried at ne's ability to run, giants have best pass rush in football right now, pats protect brady pretty well though,
