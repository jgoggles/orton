week8

colts at titans, 1pm
most everything but ypp has this at around 2 td, big div game for titans, how will colts react after getting killed, 3rd game in a row on road for them, titans should be able to pass on them, pass eff is ind 28/31, ten 12/14, ten cant run the ball for whatever reason, TO tips to ind slightly, they hold the edge in pen too, not sure if ten can score enough to outscore them by 10, ten has only outscored bal and cle by >10, ind has only been outscored by >10 in the opener at hou and last week, feel like this could be a low scoring close game, though the pick would be more against tenn than for anything that indy can do well, which is a bit worrisome, they are banged up up front as well

dolphins at giants, 1pm
dolphins are not good, nyg coming off bye, all the numbers are close to the spread (10), giants can score, ranks 7 in off scoring, pass eff is mia 19/27 nyg 3/17, giants cant run so that could effect holding a lead, nyg forces TO, could see it being a route after the way mia lost last week

jags at texans, 1pm
hou looking to get a big leg up in div, jax coming off great def perf against but looked abysmal on off, bal only ran 12 times curiously, numbers have this around 2 td's, both have pretty good defenses, hou is average at stopping the run, big leg up to hou in TO, can they cover the 10 though against jax tough(ish) d?

min at car, 1pm
minn showed well against gb, numbers are close to the line (3.5) which i think helps the case for minn, dvoa actually has minn 2 better than car, minn can run and stop the run, car shows well in pass and run eff, car throws ints, i could sort of see this going back and forth and then it comes down to who makes the fewest mistakes and its hard to bank on either of them, both going into bye, for now stay away bc you can feel yourself WANTING to pick minn and that doesnt work, i could also see car, so WALK AWAY

saints at rams, 1pm
saints have big game at home against bucs next week, rams need to win/cover at some point, line has moved off 15.5 to 13.5, that may tip in no favor here for me, but they dont cover on the road (1-3) ats, but this is in a dome, brees is a monster, numbers have it a 3+ tds, best scoring off v worst scoring off, two worst rushing eff defenses here, might help stl, might need to stay away, regression will take place for both teams but do i want to bet on it happening or not happening this weekend? keep looking

cardinals at ravens, 1pm
ravens play steelers next week, home victory margins of 28 (pitt), 17 (nyj), 15 (hou), numbers have it at 18-20, though here's another case of familiarity with az's staff since they are all pitt dudes, beanie wells doubtful, i can see bal bouncing back off a short week from an embarrassing loss and beating the shit out of a bad cardinals, inter division hfa & travel in bals favor, 

redskins at bills in toronto, 4pm
bills coming off bye, numbers have this at about 8, i dont have a good feel for either of these teams really, ans has them close, dvoa has them separated by 17!, cant get a feel, move on

bengals at seahawks, 4pm
i dont want to bet against sea at home, and i dont want to bet into their shitty performance in cle, so nowhere to go but nowhere, they are the most schizophrenic team in the nfl, and the bengals hold that title for history, so who knows what will happen

browns at 49ers, 4pm
browns have good scoring def but also the lowest sos, niners i think have an actually good defense, the browns have an atrocious offense, i dont see how they score points in this game, i like sf here actually quite a bit

pats at steelers, 4pm
gun to the head id say ne, but i think pit will be able to move the ball against ne's crappy pass d, tough to bet against brady and tough to bet agains pit at home, plus big ben can make things happen, just watch and enjoy this one

cowboys v eagles, sunday night
I like the boys this year, i think they can take this, but phi coming off bye is enough of an unknown to sway me off it, numbers have dal winning this game, need to double check but dal might be the only team to rank in top 10 for both off and def pass and run eff, phi can cause to's though and that makes it tough to commit to dal ( along with the bye), sitting this one out, but im on the record with dal here ha ha ha

chargers at chiefs, monday
i sort of like where the chiefs are, i feel like everyone is still down on them which i like, home dogs?, chiefs have played a tougher schedule, numbers are all over the place, some have kc winning, big diff in ans, dvoa has kc one better!, kc doesnt do a whole lot well, they are decent at stopping run/stopping and rank 1st in def int rate, sd profiles the opposite in pass run basically, i sort of think the chiefs cover here, but staying off
