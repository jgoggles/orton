texans at jags, 1pm
line has moved so much, loved this at -3.5 but -7 is tough, everyone will be on this game, spreads still show that it may be worth it, fc sag srs have it at -10 or more, hou is #1 in both prs, they beat jax at home by 10 on 10/30, jags first home game since 10/24, hou coming off bye, jags have had tougher sched, jags have a good d but so does hou, jags offense sucks, sort of think jax can keep it close, revenge game, at home, getting a td with a tough d, hou has the running game to protect leinart, andre johnson is back, considering jax at +7 however

bills at jets, 1pm
no fred jackson, spreads like the bills as a whole but individually they are all over the board, ypp is at 9 which is more indicative of the bills most recent perfs, ans has them pretty damn close, while dvoa loves the jets, line seems a tad fat but fitz is scary plus its tough to say what will happen w/out jackson, laying off for now

browns at bengals, 1pm
cin won by 10 first game of the year, no aj green, bengals coming off two tough losses against pit and bal, play pit next week, spreads have this btwn 8 and 11 pts, browns defense is decent, 8th in scoring and 4th in passing, but 19 in run, i could see a low scoring game with cin winning but cle covering, cin thows some picks, which could be good against cles strong pass d

cardinals at rams, 1pm
az won at az 19-13 on 11/6, would have a hard time picking either of these teams, spreads are all over the map, some have az winning, prs have them almost equal, neither team does anything particularly well, az stops the run ok, rams are .885 sd above avg in sacks which is pretty good, rams seem to take better care of the ball and at forcing tos, i think they can win the turnover battle and cover

vikings at falcons, 1pm
spreads have this about at 9, so they are saying that with adrian peterson the falcons are 9pts better, min scoring d is 1.6sd on the wrong side, both have strong run defenses, i think atl will stack and force ponder to beat them, atl covers

bucs at titans, 1pm
bucs have top sos, titans 23, spreads have this mostly in ten's favor, pretty heavily in fact, ans has bucs at 30, bucs have worst pass d, titans 7th, bucs have a pretty terrible run d, really like ten here

panthers at colts, 1pm
colts coming off bye, spreads are all over car, except ypp which gives it to colts, this is a game between two bad defenses, an 0-10 team coming off a bye, a rookie qb on the road, etc etc, there is just too much shot here to confidently sift through, moving on

bears at raiders, 4pm
too many variables, moving on

redskins seahawks, 4pm
sea has 3rd hardest sos, spreads have this game at btwn 4-7, redskins are better in prs, seas d is above average, redskins are pretty bad across the board, thought best pass rush (was) going against worst pass protection, could be interesting and neutralize a bit sea's advantage a bit, redskins are least penalized, seahawks are 31st, sort of can see redskins stealing this one, hopefully they do...

pats at eagles, 4pm
spreads are a bit noisy, basically they have this with only a slight advantage to ne, a road non conference favorite is scary to take, esp with the eagles coming off big win where they looked pretty good and ne's shitty d, prs are a bit mixed, ans has them equal, dvoa has them far, eagles pass rush is very good, though so is pats pass protection, if vince can keep from making vital turnovers then philly will win this game, drc and namdi are out for philly and that could be huge as well, staying away but on record with philly

broncos at chargers, 4pm
spreads mostly have this inside the number, prs are mixed, dvoa has broncos 4 better, i think the chargers can score fast and that will really hurt the broncos, this is the best offense they have faced since detroit althought sd's defense isnt as stout, it comes down to who will turn the ball over more and that is a total gamble here, however my gut says sd will beat them pretty good

steelers at chiefs, snf
most spreads have this at or outside the number, the steelers should be able to score in bunches and they have the best pass d, chiefs are missing an o lineman, giving 11pts on the road is scary, esp coming off a big road win against a division opponent, then playing cin again next week, ehh, those things make it hard to take this game..., chiefs are coming off short week, big ben has broken thumb, maybe stay away...

giants at saints, monday
spreads have this well outside the number, prs are mixed but close, i actually think the giants can cause some turnovers and keep it close to cover, but then again if the saints get the lead they should be able to protect it, similar to when nyg went into ne except in the dome...
