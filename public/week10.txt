raiders @ chargers
spreads have it under a td, dvoa has these teams separated by only one, going raiders in kamikaze and moving on

broncos @ chiefs, 1pm
most spreads have broncos winning, prs have them higher, both scoring defenses are pretty wretched, broncos should be able to pressure cassel, kc gets ints, i think the broncos can win this game, but staying away, actually im not

titans @ panthers, 1pm
spreads are closer to 5, prs are pretty close, car has a pretty good offense, they are actually just avg at turning the ball over, I dont really have a read one way or the other, if forced id say car

bills @cowboys, 1pm
spreads mostly have this in buffalo's favor, prs are split as to who is better, dal d is average, their scoring d is good, bufs d is a tad porous, both team take care of the qb well, dal is better at getting sacks, fitz throws too many ints, and both teams can get ints,
