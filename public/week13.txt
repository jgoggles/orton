eagles at seahawks, thurs
spreads btwn even and 3, i tend to believe the eagles are better than their record shows and that may be turning into a bias which might indicate that i should not touch this game, who knows whats going on in the locker room, ans has these teams separated by 21, sea's scoring d is decent (-.576 sd), and their run d is very good (-1.515 sd) which could neutralize what the eagles do best, but their pass protection sucks and the eagles have a decent pass rush, tough to make a call here, gut says eagles win by 10, but i there are too many opposing factors which make this game too risky to play

jets at redskins, 1pm
spreads are about on the number, slightly outside, ypp has skins favored, ans has jets only 5 better, both teams are pretty avg except for jets run d (-0.713 sd), and was pass rush (1.81 sd), was causes more fumbles but jets cause more picks, thats scary with sexy rexy, jets have the tougher schedule by far, id have to say egde goes to jets bc of the ints (was is 31st in throwing ints at 1.668 sd), they will stuff the run and force rex to throw and he will fuck up, just as long as sanchez doesnt fuck up, though i do think shanny is a better coach than rex, and that could equalize things

bengals at steelers, 1pm
spreads are inside the number, showing it closer to a fg, huge game for both teams, ans has pit 13 better, initially 7 seems like way too many pts for a d as good as cins, esp after they got beat once by 7, little worried about no leon hall though, last 3 games the bengals have given up a lot of pts, do i want to bet on a rookie qb on the rd trying to keep pace with another very good defense?

titans at bills, 1pm
spreads are about at the number, ypp has ten by 10.5, ten's d is decent, ten maybe has something to play for with hou's situation, maybe buffalo is feeling a bit defeated after last week, though this is buffalo's first game home in 3 games, tough to say here

chiefs at bears, 1pm
this game is too much of a gamble

raiders at dolphins, 1pm
raiders ahave barely beaten a couple of not great teams (bears with a hurt qb), mia has looked decent, spreads are outside the number, 

ravens at browns, 4pm
spreads have this outside the number except for ypp which puts it at 1.5, bal coming off long week, is cle getting a bit too much respect for their showing v cin?, not sure how cle scores against this d but they put up 20 agains cin, both teams profile about the same in pass o/d, below avg on o but very good on d, bal has best run d, bal 2.331 sd in sacks, bals 3 losses have been on the road agains subpar teams, but this is a division game, i sort of think bal sheds that and beats the shit out of them, but is it worth the risk???
